## ReadMe.md, but you don't have to read me

Just a simple page that I created for **Hack the Pats Hack-a-thon** on Saturday, January 19, 2013 at Boston Globe lab by Daigo Fujiwara. Event was organized by Hacks Hackers Boston. 

Live here at [http://daigofuji.github.io/hack-the-nfl-2013](http://daigofuji.github.io/hack-the-nfl-2013/) Thanks you, github!
